          <p class="text-left paragraph paragraph--dark">This platform tracks stocks I am watching, and is updated frequently with 
          new fast-moving growth stocks, and market commentary.  
          There is nothing for sale here.  I track entries, exists, successes, failures and everything in between.  </p>

          <p class="text-left paragraph paragraph--dark"> The name of the game is fast-moving momentum stocks.  These are 
          companies with a new and innovative product, break-out earnings, and expanding margins.  In addition to strong 
          fundamentals, I want to see a fantastic chart with a strong trend.  Think of names like CSCO, JDSU, or QCOM of 
          the late 90s, or more recently, ROKU, SHOP, or CDLX.  These names have strong periods of price appreciation, and 
          my goal is to ride the wave up. Leadership changes quickly, so moving into and out of these names is key.  </p>

          <p class="text-left paragraph paragraph--dark">As with any site which lists stocks to trade, its best to have your
           own system before using someone elseâ€™s stock picks.  Does the name fit your criteria to purchase?  
          What will you do if a trade goes wrong?  At the end of the day, it comes down to doing your own homework.  </p>

                winning trades after the fact.  These magical people never seem to lose money on their stock picks. 
                 In fact, they are so good at trading, they need your money so they can teach you about it.  
                Too bad these clowns are paper trading and probably know less than you do.</p>
